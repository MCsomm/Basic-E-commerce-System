This C++ program simulates an e-commerce system where a customer can browse products, view details, and make purchases. It involves handling customer budgets, reducing stock quantities when purchases are made, and saving purchase data to a file. The program allows searching products by name or manufacturer and supports interactions with an online store. The product information is stored in a text file, and purchased items are saved in another text file.
